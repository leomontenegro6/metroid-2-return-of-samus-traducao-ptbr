METROID II: RETURN OF SAMUS
EJRTQ Colorization v1.3 (CRC32 A2D565B0)

Graphic Design by EJR Tairne
Programming by Justin Olbrantz (Quantam)

INSTRUCTIONS
- Use e.g. Lunar IPS to apply IPS patch to Metroid 2 Game Boy ROM with CRC32 DEE05370
- Rename resulting file to .gbc extension to ensure emulators correctly load it as a Game Boy Color ROM
- NOTE: As it is a GBC-only ROM, it will NOT run on Game Boy, Super Game Boy 1/2, or emulators that do not support GBC

KNOWN ISSUES / NOTES
- Several cases of minor miscolored pixels due to palette limitations (e.g. Samus' helmet)
- Any differences in timing from original Metroid 2 are unintentional and should be reported as bugs

FUTURE WORK
- Create separate normal and speedrun modes. GBC contains hardware not present in original GB that can be used to speed up loading of data to increase performance above that of the original game. New normal mode would take advantage of these features, while current implementation that maintains timing of original Metroid 2 for equivalence in leaderboards would become speedrun mode.
- Fix miscolored pixels by splitting tiles
- A large suite of changes to make EJRTQ more powerful as a base for color Metroid 2 mods
